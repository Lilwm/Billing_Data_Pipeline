# Billing_Data_Pipeline

## Problem Statement
Telecom companies often have to extract billing data from multiple CSV files generated from
various systems and transform it into a structured format for analysis and revenue reporting.
This process can be time-consuming, error-prone, and hinder decision-making. Manually
analyzing and reconciling billing data from different sources is a tedious task and often leads to
delays in generating revenue reports. Thus, there is a need for an automated data pipeline that
can extract billing data from multiple sources and transform it into a structured format for
efficient analysis and revenue reporting.

## project deliverable
* **Determine the requirements:** First, you need to define the requirements of the data
pipeline, including the source and destination of the data, the type of data that needs to
be processed, the transformations that need to be applied, and the output format.
Extract the data: Use Python to read the CSV files and extract the data.
* **Clean the data:** Perform data cleaning on the extracted data to remove any missing
values and outliers. For example, you can replace missing values with an appropriate
value or remove them altogether.
* **Transform the data:** Apply any necessary transformations on the data, such as data
type conversion, data aggregation, and data filtering, to prepare the data for analysis.
* **Merge the datasets:** Join the different datasets into a single dataset that can be used for
analysis.
* **Load the data:** Load the transformed data into a database or a file, such as a CSV file,
that can be easily analyzed.
* **Automate the process:** Automate the data pipeline by scheduling it to run at a specific
time, such as daily or weekly so that it can update the analysis data automatically.
* **Test the pipeline:** Test the data pipeline to ensure it produces the correct results. This
can be done by comparing the results with the expected output or using a test dataset.
* **Optimize the pipeline:** Optimize the data pipeline to improve performance and reduce
errors. This can be done by optimizing the code, parallel processing, and reducing the
data size.
* **Monitor the pipeline:** Monitor the data pipeline to ensure that it runs smoothly and that
there are no errors or issues.
